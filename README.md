Unity - Made for the 72 hour Quarantine Game Jam

I teamed up with an artist and sfx/ music composer for this jam and it was well worth it.
You can look at the game page on https://dominikalk.itch.io/pack-yak-bandit

Please bear in mind that this was made in a very short time frame so the code isnt neat at all :)
